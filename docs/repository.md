## What is and isn't committed

| | |
|---|---|
| **Committed** | LaTeX sources, compiled deck and exam PDFs, notebooks with outputs, datasets, this documentation |
| **Git-ignored** | `Source_Material/` (copyrighted textbook PDF and figure banks), LaTeX build artefacts (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.nav`, …), `.venv/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `Lab_Notebooks/data/`, `docs/_build/`, and the documentation's staged copies (`docs/labs/`, `docs/_extra/`) |

Compiled PDFs *are* committed on purpose: a colleague should be able to clone
the repository and teach from it without a TeX installation.

## Naming conventions

- Chapter numbers always follow **ISLP**, zero-padded to two digits
  (`chapter_04`), so slides, labs and datasets line up. The gaps (9, 11, 12 have
  labs but no deck) are intentional — those chapters are self-study.
- Exam folders are named for the lecture they follow
  (`Exam_2_after_Lecture_08`), not for a date, so the calendar can shift without
  renaming anything.
- Exam PDFs use `Title_Case`, their LaTeX sources `snake_case` — the `-jobname`
  argument in the build command is what maps one to the other.
