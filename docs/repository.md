## What is and isn't committed

| | |
|---|---|
| **Committed** | Deck LaTeX sources and compiled PDFs, notebooks with outputs, datasets, this documentation |
| **Git-ignored** | `Mock_Exams/` (assessment material — exams, solutions and their sources), `Source_Material/` (copyrighted textbook PDF and figure banks), LaTeX build artefacts (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.nav`, …), `.venv/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `Lab_Notebooks/data/`, `docs/_build/`, and the documentation's staged copies (`docs/labs/`, `docs/_extra/`) |

Compiled deck PDFs *are* committed on purpose: a colleague should be able to
clone the repository and teach from it without a TeX installation. The exams
are the exception — publishing worked solutions to a public repository would
make them useless as assessment.

## Naming conventions

- Chapter numbers always follow **ISLP**, zero-padded to two digits
  (`chapter_04`), so slides, labs and datasets line up. The gaps are intentional:
  chapters 9, 11 and 12 have a notebook but no deck, because they are untaught
  [code references](labs.md) rather than labs.
- Exam folders are named for the lecture they follow
  (`Exam_2_after_Lecture_08`), not for a date, so the calendar can shift without
  renaming anything.
- Exam PDFs use `Title_Case`, their LaTeX sources `snake_case` — the `-jobname`
  argument in the build command is what maps one to the other.
